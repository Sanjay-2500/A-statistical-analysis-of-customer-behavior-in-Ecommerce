# Ecommerce-Customers
# Linear Regression 

We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.


A statistical analysis of customer behavior indicates that:

A 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of $25.98 in total dollars spent.
A 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of $38.59 in total dollars spent.
A 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with a modest increase of $0.19 in total dollars spent.
A 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with a substantial increase of $61.27 in total dollars spent.
